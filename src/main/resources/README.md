Make dispensers use spears like a weapon!

## Added / Fixed

- Join message only shows on join and not every level load (Bug)
- Fixed mods.toml: issueTrackerURL, displayURL, logoFile, credits, updateJSONURL are now added (Bug)
- Spear now retracts even if other item in dispenser is not spear (Bug)

## Plans

For now we want to add:

- Make spear also retract if dispenser is empty (Bug)
- Add command for clean up (Idea)
- Add collision to the spear (Idea)
- Make every spear hit with its own attack damage (Idea)
